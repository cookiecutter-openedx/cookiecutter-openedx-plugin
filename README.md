An [Open edX Plugin](https://blog.lawrencemcdaniel.com/getting-started-with-open-edx-plugin-architecture/) that implements customizations for deployment to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Implements the following:

- Hooks for openedx Django Signals for 'user_logged_in', 'user_logged_out', 'register_user', 'course_enrollment_created', 'certificate_created' and more. Demonstrates both the legacy, and the newer methodology for subscribing to and listening for the signals.
- Scaffolding for waffle flag setup, including Django model initializations. These are currently only used to enable Django Signals.
- A [custom badges backend](https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/lms/djangoapps/badges/backends) that is compatible with [django-storages backend for Amazon S3](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html)

## Getting Started

### Install using Tutor

See [Installing extra xblocks and requirements](https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/configuration.html)

```bash
tutor config save       # to ensure that tutor's root folder system has been created

# OPTION 1: install as a PyPi package
echo "cookiecutter-openedx-plugin==0.1.1" >> "$(tutor config printroot)/env/build/openedx/requirements/private.txt"

# OPTION 2: install as an editable requirement
echo "git+https://github.com/cookiecutter-openedx/cookiecutter-openedx-plugin.git" >> "$(tutor config printroot)/env/build/openedx/requirements/private.txt"

cat "$(tutor config printroot)/env/build/openedx/requirements/private.txt"
tutor images build openedx
tutor local quickstart
```

### Getting Started With Local development

* Use the same virtual environment that you use for edx-platform
* Ensure that your Python interpreter to 3.8x
* install black: <https://pypi.org/project/black/>
* install flake8: <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>
* install flake8-coding: <https://pypi.org/project/flake8-coding/>

```bash
# Run these from within your edx-platform virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

cd /path/to/edx-platform
pip install -r requirements/edx/base.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/coverage.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/development.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/pip-tools.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/testing.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/doc.txt
pip install -r requirements/edx/paver.txt

pip install pre-commit black flake8
pre-commit install
```

#### Local development good practices

* run `black` on modified code before committing.
* run `flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics`
* run `flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics`
* run `pre-commit run --all-files` before pushing. see: <https://pre-commit.com/>

#### edx-platform dependencies

To avoid freaky version conflicts in prod it's a good idea to install all of the edx-platform requirements to your local dev virtual environment.

* requirements/edx/base.txt
* requirements/edx/develop.txt,
* requirements/edx/testing.txt

At a minimum this will give you the full benefit of your IDE's linter.
