# django-storages version 1.9 drops support for boto storage backend.
django-storages<1.9

# The team that owns this package will manually bump this package rather than having it pulled in automatically.
# This is to allow them to better control its deployment and to do it in a process that works better
# for them.
edx-enterprise==3.42.5

# 4.5.1 introduced a bug when used together with xmlsec: https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1880251

# oauthlib>3.0.1 causes test failures ( also remove the django-oauth-toolkit constraint when this is fixed )
oauthlib==3.0.1

# django-auth-toolkit==1.3.3 requires oauthlib>=3.1.0 which is pinned because of test failures
django-oauth-toolkit<=1.3.2

# Will be updated once we update python-dateutil package
matplotlib<3.4.0

# Constraint from astroid 2.3.3

# greater version has breaking changes and requires some migration steps.
django-webpack-loader==0.7.0

# Release 2.1.0 pulls declares `pact-python` as a base requirement, even though it should be
# a testing requirement. Installing it would cause a bunch of new tool packages to become base
# requirements of edx-platform. Pinning temporarily until this is resolved in edx-val.
edxval<2.1

# At the time of writing this comment, we do not know whether py2neo>=2022

# mistune is a dependency of m2r (which is a dependency of sphinxcontrib-openapi)
# m2r fails to specify the version of mistune that it needs leading to the error message:
# AttributeError: module 'mistune' has no attribute 'BlockGrammar'
# See Issue: https://github.com/miyakogi/m2r/issues/66
# m2r is no longer actively maintained: https://github.com/miyakogi/m2r/pull/43
# This will be fixed when sphinxcontrib-openapi depends on m2r2 instead of m2r
# See issue: https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/openapi/issues/123
mistune<2.0.0

# django-celery-results==2.3.0 requires psycopg2 as dependency but hasn't explicitly added in package requirements.
# The PR https://github.com/celery/django-celery-results/pull/292 fixing this issue has been merged but
# new version hasn't been released yet with the fix so pinning the version until django-celery-results>2.3.0 is out.
django-celery-results<2.3.0
