# These can be installed manually using:

# Please follow these guidelines whenever you change this file:
#
# 1. When adding a new dependency, add a comment to the end of the line
#    explaining why it is needed.
# 2. Do not pin exact versions unless absolutely necessary.  When upgrading
#    an already-pinned package to its latest release, remove the version pin.
# 3. Do not add indirect dependencies unless a version constraint is needed to
#    avoid versions which have known problems.
# 4. If the package is not needed in production, add it to another file such
#    as development.in or testing.in instead.
